# WebScrapingTest
Test Repository to learn web scraping

# Flow of Program:

Quite simple flow, to start off add some urls in `url.txt` and the program will follow each link through the program
and scrape any plaintext stored in `p` tags. 


This example is focused on **BBC Bitesize** as the project is needed for UoB Bristol Interaction Group's project.

Key tip to follow is if you'd like to add any buzzwords to the list of ignored buzzwords that's inline in the code as a list.
For example, the signup class is ignored on the pages in on the bbc bitesize page!
