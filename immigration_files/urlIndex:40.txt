The Huguenots had a huge economic impact on Britain. They revitalised the silk weaving trade, kick-started various manufacturing industries, such as cutlery making in Sheffield, and invested heavily in growing businesses. The skills and energies of Huguenot immigrants played an important part in the transformation of Britain into Europeâ€™s major industrial power. Many Huguenots joined the armed forces, with some even rising to the highest officer positions.
Huguenots were key investors in the Bank of England and its first Governor was descended from Huguenot immigrants. They were also at the heart of the growth of capitalism. The Bank - and the creation of the National Debt - meant that the government could borrow money to fight wars that enabled the British Empire to grow and protected the Atlantic for slave ships and the plantation system.
Walloons, Huguenots and later Jews were allowed to have their own places of worship. At that time the same freedom was not allowed to English Nonconformists or Catholics. However, the allowances given to Protestant and Jewish refugees paved the way to similar freedoms for other groups and helped make British society more open to religious differences.
Over a few generations, Huguenots integrated well into British society. Up to a quarter of Londoners may have some Huguenot ancestry.  Huguenot fashions and styles, influenced by their own craftspeople, became fashionable.
