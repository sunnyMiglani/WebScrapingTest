During World War One, 32,000 Germans and Austrians, seen as ‘enemy aliens,’ were interned in camps and had their wealth seized by the government. Germans and Italians received similar treatment in World War Two and some were sent by ship to Canada and Australia. In July 1940, a German submarine sank one of the ships, the Arandora Star, resulting in 805 deaths. The sinking of the Arandora Star and the ill treatment of internees on another ship, the Dunera, a week later led to an outcry in Parliament which resulted in the first releases of internees in August 1940. By 1942 fewer than 5,000 remained interned. 
    
Throughout most of this period there were ever tighter controls on immigration.
All the above laws restricted immigration, except for the 1948 Act which opened doors because the UK needed more workers after World War Two. The 1962 Act, which aimed to restrict numbers, backfired. Many men who were working here at the time were eventually intending to return to their families; however they realised that they may not be readmitted if they went home to visit so they brought their families to join them and decided to settle permanently.
After the 1970s, immigration from EU member states had to be allowed by European law, so most legislation was aimed at refugees and asylum seekers.
By 2007, however, the immigration system was out of control, with a massive backlog of people claiming asylum whose cases had not yet been dealt with. The UK Border Agency was set up to try and deal with the problem.
During the same period laws were passed to promote better community relations, and prevent racial discrimination and racist hate crimes.
