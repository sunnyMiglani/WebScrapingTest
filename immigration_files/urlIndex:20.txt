The most obvious impact of the Jews brought over by King William I can be seen in the way he and his successors spent the funds they borrowed from moneylenders. The money was used to build castles, cathedrals and churches. It paid soldiers’ wages as Norman kings exerted their power in England and northern France.  It enabled the Normans to rule. Meanwhile, in the towns where they lived, Jewish moneylenders made it possible for local businesses to start up with loans to get them on their feet.
However, the later treatment of England’s Jews set a dark precedent. The Blood Libel originated in England and spread across Europe resulting in the murder of many Jews. England was the first place to make Jews wear a yellow badge, a measure copied by Nazis in the 20th century. After Jews were deported from England in 1290, other countries copied and expelled Jews.
