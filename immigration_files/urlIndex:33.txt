When the biggest wave of Huguenots came in the 1680s they were granted denization by King Charles II, mainly because they were victims of the French King Louis XIV (England’s greatest enemy at the time). At a time when English Nonconformists and Catholics were not allowed to worship freely, Walloons and Huguenots were allowed their own churches.
Although some were rich, with relatives already living here, many refugees were poor and dependent on handouts. The Anglican Church organised collections of money to help support the refugees.
Walloons and Huguenots settled mainly in London and the south-east of England, often setting up communities in distinct areas such as Soho in London. In addition to their religion, Walloons and Huguenots were also welcomed because they brought much-needed skills and wealth that helped to boost England’s economy. One particular skill was wool and silk weaving. In places like Canterbury and Spitalfields in East London, Huguenot entrepreneurs employed large numbers of poorer Huguenots as their weavers.
They also introduced many other skills to England, such as feather and fan work, high-quality clock making, woodcarving, papermaking, clothing design and cutlery making.
