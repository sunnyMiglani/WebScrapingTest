Most people were farmers who lived in the same villages all of their lives.  Some were freemen owning their own land but many were villeins who worked for their lord in return for some land. Most people ate what they grew. Other things they needed they would either make themselves or buy in local markets. The markets were in towns where craftspeople, merchants and traders lived with their servants. The making and selling of goods was controlled by the different craft guilds which had a lot of power. Everything was made by hand and artists and craftspeople were greatly valued.
England had a mainly primary economy, producing raw materials. Its most valuable export was high quality wool which merchants sold to weavers in the Low Countries who made it into cloth.  Kings who wanted to increase their wealth to fight wars did so by taxing goods coming in and out of England. They realised that England - and the Crown - would be richer if people learned how to weave fine woollen cloth themselves and sell it overseas.
Death was very present in peopleâ€™s lives. Many mothers died in childbirth, infant mortality was high and in the mid 14th century the Black Death killed up to half the population. This caused a serious labour shortage: England needed farm workers, servants and craftspeople all over the country.
The monarchy and the Church looked for ways to borrow money for wars and building projects. They needed to find wealthy people who would lend them money: however, the Church did not allow Catholics to lend money with interest.
