Although most medieval immigrants settled peacefully and became part of their communities, at times of crisis they could be vulnerable and at risk of violent attacks.
The craft guilds in cities such as London believed foreign workers were undercutting them and so saw them as a threat to their members’ livelihoods.
They frequently put pressure on their rulers to impose controls on immigrant workers.
All of these measures were imposed because English merchants placed a lot of pressure on weak kings.
Wealthy foreigners were often hated because people believed they received special privileges and saw them as being on the side of the rulers.  During the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt rioters in London murdered about 150 foreign weavers and merchants. The story goes that they were asked to say the words ‘bread and cheese’ and if they answered with an accent, they were beheaded.
In times of war, ‘enemy aliens’ could have their goods confiscated or be deported. Flemish merchants, French migrants and Irish immigrants were all expelled from England at different times. 
Many people resented foreign merchants and bankers who they thought had come only to make money for themselves. During the 1381 revolt and again in 1492, the London steelyard was destroyed by rioters.
One of the most useful sources for detail of medieval immigrants’ lives, is also an example of how pressure was put on immigrants. The 1440 alien subsidies were special taxes imposed on aliens as a result of anti-foreigner pressure. They record the names, occupations and places of residence of immigrants at the time.
Think about this statement:
‘Medieval England was a very difficult place for foreigners to settle in.’ How far do you agree?
Read through this guide making a note of evidence to support this statement.  Why were foreigners and minority groups sometimes made to feel unwelcome?
Then read through making a note of evidence to oppose the statement. Why were foreign migrants sometimes welcomed?
