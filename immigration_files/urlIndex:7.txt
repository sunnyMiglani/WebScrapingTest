England was a Catholic country; the church was central to peopleâ€™s lives and it controlled thinking about life and death. For two hundred years from 1095, England was involved in the Crusades, a series of wars that were fought to control the lands around Jerusalem. This encouraged hostility against Jews and Muslims. Hatred against Jews - religious anti-Semitism - was stirred up by some people with power and influence.
There was great tension between the ruling class and the mass of the population who had no say in government. This sometimes erupted into rebellion when minority groups were targeted by rioters.
Many foreigners were under the protection of the monarch. This meant they could be seen as being on the side of the ruling class. When times were hard, foreigners were blamed for unemployment and rising prices.
