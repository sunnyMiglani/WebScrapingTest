Migration has played an important part in Britain's history from c1000 to the present day. It has influenced Britain’s economy, politics, culture and relationship with the wider world. 
Every single person living in Britain today is descended from immigrants. From the first settlers about 25,000 years ago, people have come here, settled and mixed with each other. Throughout our history, moving here has changed the people who came and they have changed Britain. Our changing population has been an unchanging fact. The story of migration is the story of our nation seen through the lives of all of us.
As you study migration you will encounter the major events and changes in the history of Britain.  These include the Norman Conquest, the Hundred Years' War, the Reformation, enslavement, the British Empire, the Industrial Revolution, the two World Wars, the Cold War, the European Union and the modern conflicts causing mass movement of people seeking safety. You will also see how Britain’s economy and its relationship with the wider world changed and developed over 1000 years. Immigrants to Britain played a part in all of these, sometimes a key role.
Immigration is a controversial political topic in our own time. Many of today’s issues and debates are the same as those in the past, while others are very different. Studying the history of migration will help you think about today’s arguments in context, with evidence, so that you can make informed judgements that learn from history.

Immigration was constant and needed. Most migrants settled peacefully but they were not always welcomed. Ideas of who ‘belonged’ and who did not often changed.
We are all descended from migrants. The earliest ancestors of people living in Britain today arrived about 25,000 years ago from other parts of Europe. Since then people continued to migrate here for thousands of years for three main reasons:
Trading routes by sea from Northern Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa have existed for centuries, bringing goods and people.
The Roman conquest from AD43 brought people from across the Roman Empire including Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.  Soldiers from what is now Croatia, for example, built a fort in Cumbria, and a Bulgarian cavalry officer was buried in Colchester. Some settled and made a life here.
After the Roman armies left Britain, Roman influence remained for centuries. Peoples’ lives mixed ancient British and Roman influences. Between the 5th and 11th centuries, many Germanic people - Angles, Saxons and Jutes  - arrived to conquer and settle. The kingdoms they created had a wide mix of languages and cultures. They continued to have trading links with the rest of Europe and North Africa and possibly further afield to Asia. Viking invaders settled in large numbers in the north and east in the 9th and 10th centuries and at different times England was ruled by Saxon and Viking monarchs.
England in 1000 was already a multicultural and multilingual society, and had been for centuries. We know this from various kinds of evidence:

Immigrants came to work in many occupations. Some came as refugees. The Normans came as invaders. Jews were invited by King William I because he wanted to borrow from Jewish moneylenders.

               
                 The Normans who arrived with an army in 1066 were military invaders. William  the Conqueror claimed he was the rightful King of England, and after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, he took control of England by force, becoming its ruler. William had promised all Norman nobles who joined the invasion that they could have land which was then seized from Anglo-Danish owners.
This migration was different from all the others that followed because the Normans took political and economic power and imposed their rule forcefully.
William controlled England by means of a series of connected measures. He built castles on high points with a view over towns and countryside, and with living quarters for troops. He imposed strict systems of justice and taxation and, to help him collect taxes, organised a survey of all the land and property in the kingdom. This was recorded in the Domesday Book.

      
        William also imposed the feudal system. This was a form of organisation and control in which everyone had their place. He also made sure that people close to him were in charge of the Church.

Migrants had different experiences. Norman rule was resisted unsuccessfully and Jews were terrorised and expelled. Though most migrant workers settled well, they were sometimes targeted.
The poor often hated their Norman rulers and, in the early years of King William I’s rule, there were several rebellions which were put down violently.
The Anglo-Danish lords who had lost their land and property to William's Norman lords posed a threat to William's rule. Some of them joined King Sweyn of Denmark when he invaded England in 1069, without success. In what is known as the Harrying of the North, William’s forces destroyed the countryside around York, starving out the remaining rebels, killing animals and burning crops.
When a landholder called Hereward led a rebellion in the Isle of Ely in eastern England, the Normans dealt with the uprising by using a law called murdrum. If a Norman was murdered and the killer was not found, everyone in the area had to pay a fine.
Although Hereward and other forest fighters, known at the time as the ‘green men’,   caused difficulties for the Normans, they were eventually defeated.
The Norman lords successfully imposed their rule on England. The main threat to Norman kings would be their own relatives and other lords who challenged their position. Over the centuries there were many battles for power which resulted in civil wars.

The impact of migration was huge, from how the Normans governed with Jewish money to how migrants kick-started manufacturing and trade. There were also tensions that sometimes exploded dangerously.
The Norman conquerors and their descendants, who controlled England for centuries, had a huge impact on our laws, land ownership and system of government which is still felt today.  They invaded and colonised England and organised the fastest and deepest transfer of land and wealth in the country’s history. Within a few years of William the Conqueror becoming king, over 40 per cent of the land was in the hands of a small number of people, all of whom were foreign.
The Normans abolished slavery after information collected for the Domesday Book had revealed that about 10 per cent of the people were slaves.  The way we name ourselves also comes from the Normans because they introduced the system of surnames to show people’s occupations or where they had migrated from.
The Normans also introduced a new language, a dialect of Old French, although for some time only the conquerors would have understood it which meant that there was one language for the rulers and another for the ruled. Over time Old English and Old French came together in one language, but the separation between ‘higher’ words of French origin (eg, commence) and the ‘common’ words of English origin (eg, begin) persists and is reflected even in 21st century newspapers.

Huge changes emerged from the Reformation, the Union with Scotland, the beginnings of empire, new global trade routes, the growth of business and the trade in enslaved Africans. 
The Reformation - when millions of people rejected the Roman Catholic Church and turned to Protestant Churches - was one of the key changes in European history and it had a significant effect on migration to Britain.
In 1500 England was a Roman Catholic country. By 1750, after the turmoil of the 16th century Reformation and the 17th century civil wars, Britain was the leading Protestant power in Europe. Catholic Spain and France were its main enemies.
   The country became a key place of safety for Protestant refugees . These included:
They were all initially welcomed but were eventually treated very differently based on their wealth and the skills they could offer.
By the mid-18th century, British society was more accepting of different religious practices, partly thanks to immigration. Protestant and Jewish communities had their own places of worship and similar freedoms were being offered to Nonconformists and, eventually, Catholics.

Most migrants came because of violence and upheaval elsewhere - religious wars, conquest or enslavement. They were affected by a changing world.
By far the largest group of immigrants in Early Modern England were Protestant refugees fleeing persecution in European countries. They came in four main waves:
After the execution of King Charles I, during the Protectorate, a small number of Jews were allowed to return, nearly 400 years after they were expelled from England. In 1655, Oliver Cromwell submitted a petition to the Council of State calling for Jews to be allowed to return to Britain. He met with resistance at the Whitehall Conference in December that year. Ultimately it was decided that as England’s Jews had been expelled in 1290 by a king, and there were no longer kings ruling England, the previous expulsion had no legal basis.
Cromwell accepted Jews for several reasons. He thought they might be a source of revenue and help him fight against his Catholic enemies. He was also persuaded by Dutch rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel to help Jews fleeing persecution in many parts of Europe. Cromwell shared a widely-held view that the end of the world was coming. In keeping with Bible teaching, he believed that Jews would be recalled from the four corners of the world at the time of the Last Judgement.
During the late medieval and Tudor period, nomadic Gypsies began arriving in England. Over the centuries they had migrated from northern India through Central Europe.

While most Protestant refugees were welcomed, other groups, such as Gypsies and foreign Catholics, were not. Africans and Jews settled quietly but enslavement and empire brought great change.

    
    Most Walloons and Huguenots were well received because they were seen as allies and fellow Protestants. When the biggest wave of Huguenots came in the 1680s they were granted denization by King Charles II, mainly because they were victims of the French King Louis XIV (England’s greatest enemy at the time). At a time when English Nonconformists and Catholics were not allowed to worship freely, Walloons and Huguenots were allowed their own churches.
Although some were rich, with relatives already living here, many refugees were poor and dependent on handouts. The Anglican Church organised collections of money to help support the refugees.
Walloons and Huguenots settled mainly in London and the south-east of England, often setting up communities in distinct areas such as Soho in London. In addition to their religion, Walloons and Huguenots were also welcomed because they brought much-needed skills and wealth that helped to boost England’s economy. One particular skill was wool and silk weaving. In places like Canterbury and Spitalfields in East London, Huguenot entrepreneurs employed large numbers of poorer Huguenots as their weavers.
They also introduced many other skills to England, such as feather and fan work, high-quality clock making, woodcarving, papermaking, clothing design and cutlery making.

Huguenot investment and skills helped bring greater wealth to Britain, as did the expansion of a trading empire and the slave trade. Ideas about racial difference also began to spread.
The Huguenots had a huge economic impact on Britain. They revitalised the silk weaving trade, kick-started various manufacturing industries, such as cutlery making in Sheffield, and invested heavily in growing businesses. The skills and energies of Huguenot immigrants played an important part in the transformation of Britain into Europe’s major industrial power. Many Huguenots joined the armed forces, with some even rising to the highest officer positions.
Huguenots were key investors in the Bank of England and its first Governor was descended from Huguenot immigrants. They were also at the heart of the growth of capitalism. The Bank - and the creation of the National Debt - meant that the government could borrow money to fight wars that enabled the British Empire to grow and protected the Atlantic for slave ships and the plantation system.
Walloons, Huguenots and later Jews were allowed to have their own places of worship. At that time the same freedom was not allowed to English Nonconformists or Catholics. However, the allowances given to Protestant and Jewish refugees paved the way to similar freedoms for other groups and helped make British society more open to religious differences.
Over a few generations, Huguenots integrated well into British society. Up to a quarter of Londoners may have some Huguenot ancestry.  Huguenot fashions and styles, influenced by their own craftspeople, became fashionable.

British wealth and power came from the slave plantations, trade, the factory system and empire. Migrant workers from across the world made this possible and helped to lead movements for change.
In 1750 the triangular trade in enslaved Africans was at its height. Sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations in the Caribbean and North America were bringing great profits to Britain’s businesses and banks. Some of these profits were invested in the entrepreneurs and inventors of the Industrial Revolution.
Britain’s black population was growing and consisted both of people tied to their owners as servants  and of free black people in a variety of occupations including a shopkeeper, a publican, an actor, a violinist and members of the armed forces. Parish records of births, marriages and deaths show that black people were living in all parts of Britain.
Opposition to slavery grew thanks to the publication of autobiographies written by former enslaved people which highlighted the abuse of their human rights.  The slave uprisings on the Caribbean plantations also drew attention to the plight of enslaved people. Opposition became a mass movement in which some British people of African origin played leading roles.
In 1807 Parliament abolished the slave trade and, after many slave rebellions in the Caribbean, enslavement in the British Empire officially ended in 1833 under the Slavery Abolition Act. Emancipation did not bring immediate freedom: former enslaved people were still tied to their owners as apprentices for a time. Meanwhile the slave owners received huge financial compensation from the British government during the 1830s for the loss of their 'property'. This payment was part of the Act and one of the reasons why wealthy, often slave-owning, Members of Parliament (MPs) agreed to it.
Although enslavement still continued illegally for some years, the law was now clear. However, the trade in enslaved Africans had left a poisonous legacy of racist ideas based on skin colour. To justify the slave trade, control the plantations and divide black plantation workers from their white fellow-labourers, ideas of racial difference grew and took hold. Black people were dehumanised and portrayed as inferior.

People migrated to Britain for different reasons - forced labour, poverty, hope of work, business and to escape to safety. All came because of Britain’s wealth, empire and world dominance.
We do not know exactly how many people of African origin were living in Britain in the late 18th century. Many were here as a result of the Transatlantic Trade in enslaved Africans.
After emancipation, when Parliament abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, and during the 19th century black people continued to come here in smaller numbers and settle. They included refugees escaping enslavement in the United States of America.
Others who were forced to come here were merchant seamen from India, Africa and the West Indies who were hired in their homelands but then abandoned in ports on their arrival here, becoming ‘accidental migrants’. Opposition from white seamen and their union meant it was hard for them to get jobs on ships which could return them to their homes.

Large numbers of migrants fleeing hardship found work in industrial Britain. Most saw their lives improve slowly, though many faced often appalling living conditions and growing racial prejudice.
Before slavery in the British Empire was abolished under the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, the status of black people in Britain was complex. This was because the law was not clear. British law allowed enslavement overseas, on the slave ships from West Africa and the West Indian plantations.  Inside the British Isles, however, slavery was not legally sanctioned.
Some black people were held in conditions of enslavement here in Britain and some were violently abused. We know this from advertisements about runaways and from court cases. However most Africans lived here in freedom, as can be seen from parish records. Court documents show Africans accused of crime were treated in the same way as white people. A few Africans thrived in Britain: Ignatius Sancho who was born on a slave ship became a wealthy composer, actor, and writer and was the first black Briton to be allowed to vote in elections.
The case of James Somerset in 1772 was important. He had escaped from his master who then recaptured him in Britain and tried to force him to return to Jamaica. The Lord Chief Justice ruled that he could not be taken from Britain by force. While in Britain, he was free.
It is not clear whether there was a distinct black community in places like London and Liverpool, or whether black people lived as part of the wider working class. After 1833 and in the later 19th century, their presence is harder to trace because they were not recorded as ‘black’ in census returns. Paintings, cartoons and later photographs often show black people present in many parts of Britain, and it is likely that many people were of African descent, often through intermarriage. They appear to have been assimilated into the wider population.
The ‘Black Loyalists’ who had been promised freedom from enslavement if they fought for Britain in the American War of Independence, were brought here when Britain lost the war. Many of them ended up destitute, begging on London’s streets. Over 400 were transported to Sierra Leone in West Africa in a resettlement project by the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor.
Autobiographies by people who had previously been enslaved - Mary Prince, Ottobah Cugonao and Olaudah Equiano - helped turn many people against slavery and the trade in enslaved people. Prince who suffered terrible treatment at the hands of her owners published her autobiography, The History of Mary Prince: A West Indian Slave in 1831 and was the first black woman to do so. Equiano and Cugoano also played leading roles in the campaign for the abolition of enslavement with their organisation ‘Sons of Africa’. The Abolition movement has influenced many campaigns for justice since. 
William Davidson and Robert Wedderburn were both the children of black enslaved mothers and white fathers who became political activists against slavery and for the rights of working people. Davidson was hanged and beheaded for his part in the Cato Street Conspiracy - a plot to assassinate leaders of the government.
William Cuffay (from St Kitts in the Caribbean) was a leader of the Chartist movement for political reform, and was convicted of preparing to set fire to certain buildings as a signal for an uprising and was transported to Tasmania in 1848. Many of the Chartists’ demands are now an accepted part of our Parliamentary system, such as secret ballots in elections, votes for all and payment to MPs so that not only the rich could stand for election.
Some black people, such as Queen Victoria’s god-daughter Lady Sarah Forbes Bonetta, the nurse Mary Seacole and the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, achieved success and prominence in late Victorian society. There were several popular black entertainers such as the circus owner Pablo Fanque whose company travelled all over the country.
This was a time when ‘pseudo-scientific’ racist ideas, justifying enslavement and empire by dehumanising people who had been colonised, were widely held. One notable case was the African American actor Ira Aldridge. Although he was a highly successful performer of Shakespeare’s leading roles all over Europe, his performance of Othello in London received racist reviews and was forced to close.

Britain was at the height of it's global power and mass immigration impacted on all aspects of life: from food and fashion to faith, politics and commerce.
Between 1750 and 1900 Britain’s wealth depended on industry. It needed raw materials to be shipped from around the world. British factories then made manufactured goods, such as clothing and machinery, which were transported across the country and exported to the world. Coal was the fuel that powered the factory machines and Britain was fortunate to be rich in coal deposits. Coal was also exported, bringing more profit to this country.
At the same time, consumer goods, such as tea, sugar and tobacco, were shipped to Britain and traded here, bringing profit to planters, shipping companies, merchants and shopkeepers.
Immigrant labour was at the heart of all these processes.
Industrial Britain needed cheap labour, which migration provided. Economic growth created more jobs for British workers. By 1900, although wide gaps in wealth existed, living and working conditions for most people were better than they had previously been.

While levels were low in the early 20th century, the later period saw mass immigration. The 20th and early 21st centuries were also a time of increased immigration controls. 
This was a period of growing tension in the world and growing anti-immigrant feeling in the UK. This came partly from some politicians and much of the popular press who stirred up feeling against Jewish immigrants to get votes or increase sales, and partly from the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union  who resented foreign merchant seamen, especially the Chinese.
The 1905 Aliens Act severely restricted immigration, the first of many laws to do so in the 20th century. Public opinion was also turned against foreign immigrants as a result of a series of terrorist actions, including the ‘Houndsditch Outrage’ and the ‘Siege of Sidney Street’, which were carried out in London by opponents of the Russian government. In the years that followed 1905, immigration levels were low.
World War One brought a sharp rise in nationalism and violence directed against German and Austrian residents. This was especially the case in 1915 when a German submarine sank a passenger ship, the Lusitania. Many German shops and businesses were attacked and Germans and Austrians were taken away and interned.
On the other hand, some immigrants were welcomed during the war. A quarter of a million Belgians fleeing their wartorn country - the biggest influx of refugees ever to the UK - were generally welcomed and well received and thousands of wounded Indian troops were looked after in Brighton’s Grand Pavilion.
After the war, there were serious tensions over employment between returning servicemen and seamen from Africa, Asia and the West Indies. Violence with a strong racist element erupted in 1919 in Liverpool, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and other ports. These riots took place between January and August and resulted in five deaths and many vandalised properties.

Immigration was usually due to a search for work or safety. Numbers grew in the late 20th and early 21st centuries because of the EU’s free movement policies and humanitarian crises in many countries.
Immigration controls in the early 20th century made it difficult for people to settle in Britain. One group which did manage to put down roots were immigrant seamen hired to work on merchant ships. This was a result of many white seamen being called to serve in the armed forces during World War One and World War Two. Others included West African stowaways on cargo ships.
After World War Two, a mass immigration of people coming to work in Britain began. Many of the early arrivals were from the West Indies, South Asia and Cyprus. The most famous arrival was of people from the Caribbean, mainly Jamaica and Trinidad, on the ship Empire Windrush in 1948. This is sometimes mistakenly referred to as the first arrival of black people in Britain.
As the UK economy picked up and then boomed in the late 1950s and 1960s, migrants from India, East and West Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana and many other Commonwealth countries came to work in the textile factories of the North of England and the engineering factories of the Midlands.  
    
During the 1980s and 1990s many people from countries outside the Commonwealth or the European Union, such as Colombia, Morocco and the Philippines, came to fill low-paid jobs as waiters, cleaners and chambermaids.
Under the European Union’s ‘free movement of workers’, hundreds of thousands of women and men from EU countries came to the UK in the 21st century. The largest number of immigrants came from Poland and they worked mainly in the service sector.

Migrants experienced immigration controls, discrimination and organised racism and had to struggle for acceptance. Nevertheless, the UK has become increasingly at ease with its cultural diversity.
During World War One, 32,000 Germans and Austrians, seen as ‘enemy aliens,’ were interned in camps and had their wealth seized by the government. Germans and Italians received similar treatment in World War Two and some were sent by ship to Canada and Australia. In July 1940, a German submarine sank one of the ships, the Arandora Star, resulting in 805 deaths. The sinking of the Arandora Star and the ill treatment of internees on another ship, the Dunera, a week later led to an outcry in Parliament which resulted in the first releases of internees in August 1940. By 1942 fewer than 5,000 remained interned. 
    
Throughout most of this period there were ever tighter controls on immigration.
All the above laws restricted immigration, except for the 1948 Act which opened doors because the UK needed more workers after World War Two. The 1962 Act, which aimed to restrict numbers, backfired. Many men who were working here at the time were eventually intending to return to their families; however they realised that they may not be readmitted if they went home to visit so they brought their families to join them and decided to settle permanently.
After the 1970s, immigration from EU member states had to be allowed by European law, so most legislation was aimed at refugees and asylum seekers.
By 2007, however, the immigration system was out of control, with a massive backlog of people claiming asylum whose cases had not yet been dealt with. The UK Border Agency was set up to try and deal with the problem.
During the same period laws were passed to promote better community relations, and prevent racial discrimination and racist hate crimes.

While there are contrary views about how immigration has affected British society, the impact has clearly been considerable in all areas of UK life.
Immigration has had a huge impact on the UK’s economy. Migrant labour from the Commonwealth helped reconstruct the country after World War Two and maintain the transport and health services. Bus conductors and drivers and hospital nurses and doctors from many parts of the world were crucial to these services, and remain so today.  Migrant factory workers were essential to many businesses in the 1960s and 1970s. The catering and hotel businesses - a major earner for the British economy - continue to be heavily staffed by immigrant workers.
The topic of immigration has always divided opinion, especially when it comes to the economy. Supporters of immigration argue that it creates more jobs, helps boost the economy and keeps inflation down. Opponents argue that immigration causes unemployment, reduces wages overall and puts too much pressure on public services such as health and education.  Recent studies, however, are inconclusive: 
Supporters of the European Union (EU) free movement of people argue that the economic boom of the early 2000s was partly thanks to migrant workers taking lower paid jobs in the service sector and paying taxes to support care for an ageing population. Opponents argue that, especially since the 2008 financial market crash, too many people are coming into the UK and our housing stock, schools and hospitals cannot cope. All sides of the argument, including those who argue for much stricter immigration controls, agree that some immigration is needed to keep the economy going.
