It is useful to divide the period 1925-1955 into three phases:
After World War One, Germany began a bold experiment with representative democracy. All adult Germans were able to vote and the system of proportional representation meant a wide range of views were given a voice in Parliament. There was also an elected President.
However, the legacy of defeat in the war, in the shape of crippling reparations payments and the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, led to serious problems:
Rescued by Gustav Stresemann and American loans, which enabled reparations payments to be made, Germany eventually recovered from these crises. By the late 1920s the Weimar Republic was a key member of the League of Nations, a hotbed of modern culture and feeling increasingly prosperous, though its unstable governments left it vulnerable to any new crisis that might emerge.
During this period, the Nazi Party was established (in 1920) and Hitler became its leader. He tried to seize power in the 
Munich Putsch in 1923, during the hyperinflation crisis and was briefly jailed. From then on, the party committed itself to winning power by legitimate means through elections. However, although its membership grew throughout the 1920s, by 1928 it had only a handful of seats in the Reichstag as Weimar politics stabilised and extreme voices like the Nazis fell on deaf ears.
A crisis emerged in 1929 as the Wall Street Crash brought a worldwide depression. Germany suffered more than any other nation as a result of the recall of US loans, which caused its economy to collapse. Unemployment rocketed, poverty soared and Germans became desperate. This led to a chain of events that ended in the destruction of German democracy:
