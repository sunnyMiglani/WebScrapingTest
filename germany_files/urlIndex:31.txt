Historians tend to define ‘opposition’ in Nazi Germany as any acts which openly defied the regime, while 'resistance' is taken to mean active attempts to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis. There were obviously a great deal more of the former than of the latter. However, it is also generally acknowledged that the regime was widely accepted and enjoyed much popular support.
It is difficult to know exactly how popular the regime was as Hitler’s police state made it very difficult to express opposition and Nazi propaganda portrayed the Führer as his people’s saviour. However, it is clear that the Nazis were the most popular party when they came to power and many Germans welcomed the stability and economic growth an authoritarian regime brought.
In general, Germans were happy to trade the freedom and democracy of Weimar for the certainty and security Hitler brought. His regime restored Germany’s international prestige through rearmament and the dismantling of the Treaty of Versailles. The sheer scale of propaganda - especially that directed towards German children - meant that many more Germans became active Nazi Party members and were convinced of Hitler’s greatness.

Perhaps the most widespread and persistent opposition to the Nazi regime came from ordinary German workers, often helped by Communists, who posted anti-Nazi posters and graffiti, or organised strikes. In Dortmund the vast majority of men imprisoned in the city’s jail were industrial workers. Workers went on strike over high food prices in 1935 and during the Berlin Olympics in 1936.
In 1944, a group of army officers tried to assassinate Hitler. A bomb was planted by Colonel Stauffenberg at meeting attended by Hitler. It exploded, but Hitler survived. In retaliation, Stauffenberg was shot the same day and 5,000 people were executed in the crackdown on opposition that followed.
