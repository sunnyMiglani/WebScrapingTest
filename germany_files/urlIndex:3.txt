It is difficult to know the exact extent of opposition during the war as the Nazis controlled information tightly and continued to monitor the German population for signs of dissent. However, the war effort was generally supported, especially against the supposedly racially inferior Russians in the east. The allied bombing campaigns weakened enthusiasm for the war but it wasn’t until the Reich itself was invaded in 1945 that German civilians’ morale collapsed.
There were two main efforts to remove Hitler during the war, one near the beginning of the conflict and one towards the end, when it was becoming clear that Germany would be defeated:
The main youth opposition group during the war was the Edelweiss Pirates, who were fond of singing anti-Nazi songs. In 1942 over 700 of them were arrested. In 1944, 12 members were publicly hanged after the Pirates in Cologne killed the Gestapo chief.
The White Rose group was formed by students at Munich University in 1943, led by brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl. They published anti-Nazi leaflets and marched through the city in protest at Nazi policies. Its leaders were eventually arrested and sentenced to the guillotine.
During the war, ‘Swing Youth’ and ‘Jazz Youth’ groups were formed. These were young people who rejected Nazi values. They drank alcohol and danced to jazz music. The Nazis rejected jazz as degenerate and called it 'Negro music', using their racial ideas against this cultural development. These youths were closely monitored by the Gestapo, who regularly raided illegal jazz clubs.
