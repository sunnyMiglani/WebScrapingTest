Example:
Explain how the Great Depression helped the Nazis to win power by 1933.
Tips:
This type of question relies on explanation. If you were to just describe the effects of the Depression, you would be limiting yourself. You need to link the effects of the Depression to the increase in popularity of the Nazi Party and maybe how it decreased the popularity of the ruling government.
Think of ‘explain’ as meaning ‘so what?’ For example, if you say the Nazis set up soup kitchens to help unemployed Germans during the Depression you should also ask yourself ‘so what?.’ This meant they would win support from people as they showed they cared about people’s problems, it also gave them the opportunity to exploit these people with their propaganda and policies when people were getting their soup.
