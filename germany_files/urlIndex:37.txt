Example:
Study Source A. Explain how this source is useful to a historian studying the Reichstag Fire.
Source A
Hermann Goering provided evidence on the Reichstag Fire at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial in 1946. These trials were to determine responsibility for Nazi atrocities. I had nothing to do with it. I deny this absolutely. I can tell you in all honesty, that the Reichstag fire proved very inconvenient to us.

I must repeat that no pretext was needed for taking measures against the Communists. I already had a number of perfectly good reasons in the forms of murders, etc.
