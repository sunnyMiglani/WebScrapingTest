William  the Conqueror claimed he was the rightful King of England, and after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, he took control of England by force, becoming its ruler. William had promised all Norman nobles who joined the invasion that they could have land which was then seized from Anglo-Danish owners.
This migration was different from all the others that followed because the Normans took political and economic power and imposed their rule forcefully.
William controlled England by means of a series of connected measures. He built castles on high points with a view over towns and countryside, and with living quarters for troops. He imposed strict systems of justice and taxation and, to help him collect taxes, organised a survey of all the land and property in the kingdom. This was recorded in the Domesday Book.

      
        William also imposed the feudal system. This was a form of organisation and control in which everyone had their place. He also made sure that people close to him were in charge of the Church.
