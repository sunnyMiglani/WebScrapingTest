We do not know exactly how many people of African origin were living in Britain in the late 18th century. Many were here as a result of the Transatlantic Trade in enslaved Africans.
After emancipation, when Parliament abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, and during the 19th century black people continued to come here in smaller numbers and settle. They included refugees escaping enslavement in the United States of America.
Others who were forced to come here were merchant seamen from India, Africa and the West Indies who were hired in their homelands but then abandoned in ports on their arrival here, becoming ‘accidental migrants’. Opposition from white seamen and their union meant it was hard for them to get jobs on ships which could return them to their homes.
