Between 1750 and 1900 Britainâ€™s wealth depended on industry. It needed raw materials to be shipped from around the world. British factories then made manufactured goods, such as clothing and machinery, which were transported across the country and exported to the world. Coal was the fuel that powered the factory machines and Britain was fortunate to be rich in coal deposits. Coal was also exported, bringing more profit to this country.
At the same time, consumer goods, such as tea, sugar and tobacco, were shipped to Britain and traded here, bringing profit to planters, shipping companies, merchants and shopkeepers.
Immigrant labour was at the heart of all these processes.
Industrial Britain needed cheap labour, which migration provided. Economic growth created more jobs for British workers. By 1900, although wide gaps in wealth existed, living and working conditions for most people were better than they had previously been.
