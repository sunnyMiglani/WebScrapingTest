The East India Company was set up by a group of English merchants who began trading in Asia after 1600, with the support of the English Crown. They set up trading posts called ‘factories’ on the coast of India which grew to become armed settlements.  These settlements needed administrators and officers and so many English men travelled out to work there.
By the mid-18th century Britain dominated trade in Asia and the East India Company took control of India. Several of the English people who went as employees of the Company hired Indian children as servants and women as nannies and wet nurses for their children. Many Company employees became extremely rich and were known as ‘nabobs’. When they returned home they sometimes brought the child servants and nannies (ayahs) with them.  They wanted to continue in England the opulent lifestyle they had enjoyed in India. These women and children were taken away from their families and communities, and from people who spoke their languages, to live in a very different environment.
In 1660, the monarchy under King Charles II set up the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa (which later became the Royal African Company). It had a monopoly over trade with West Africa, protected by the Royal Navy. English involvement in the trade in enslaved Africans grew rapidly. The small number of free Africans in England were joined by others who arrived as a result of enslavement.
How most came to Britain is unknown. Some came directly from the West African coast, while others came from the Caribbean and North America as servants.
